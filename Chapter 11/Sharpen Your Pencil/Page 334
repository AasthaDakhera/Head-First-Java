Given the following compilable statement:
Collections.sort(myArrayList);
1. What must the class of the objects stored in myArrayList implement?               -          Comparable
2. What method must the class of the objects stored in myArrayList implement?        -          compareTo()
3. Can the class of the objects stored in myArrayList implement both                 -          Yes
Comparator AND Comparable?


Given the following compilable statements (they both do the same thing):
Collections.sort(myArrayList, myCompare);
myArrayList.sort(myCompare);
4. Can the class of the objects stored in myArrayList implement Comparable?          -         Yes
5. Can the class of the objects stored in myArrayList implement Comparator?          -         Yes
6. Must the class of the objects stored in myArrayList implement Comparable?         -         No
7. Must the class of the objects stored in myArrayList implement Comparator?         -         No
8. What must the class of the myCompare object implement?                            -         Comparator
9. What method must the class of the myCompare object implement?                     -         compare()
