A class can have any number of these.             -           instance variable, method, getter, setter
A method can have only one of these.              -           return
This can be implicitly promoted.                  -           argument, return
I prefer my instance variables private.           -           encapsulation
It really means “make a copy.”                    -           pass by value
Only setters should update these.                 -           instance variable
A method can have many of these.                  -           argument
I return something by definition.                 -           getter
I shouldn’t be used with instance variables       -           public
I can have many arguments.                        -           method
By definition, I take one argument.               -           setter
These help create encapsulation.                  -           getter, setter, public, private
I always fly solo.                                -           return
