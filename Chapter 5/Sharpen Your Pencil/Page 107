We built the test class and the SimpleStartup class. But we still havenâ€™t made the
actual game. Given the code on the opposite page and the spec for the actual
game, write in your ideas for prep code for the game class

METHOD public static void main (String [] args)
  DECLARE an int variable to hold the number of user guesses, named numOfGuesses
  CREATE the SimpleStartup Object
  COMPUTE a random number between 0 and 4 that will be the starting location cell position
  CREATE integer array of size 3 assign values random, random+1, random+2
  INVOKE the setLocationCells() method
  CREATE a boolean variable to hold state of the game SET it to true

  WHILE the Startup is still alive:
    GET user input from the command line
    INVOKE checkYourself() method
    INCREMENT number of user guesses
    IF result is kill
       SET the variable representing state of game false
       PRINT the number of guesses made by the user
    END IF
  END WHILE
END METHOD
