//test code

public class SimpleStartupTestDrive {
public static void main(String[] args) {
SimpleStartup dot = new SimpleStartup();
int[] locations = {2, 3, 4};
dot.setLocationCells(locations);
int userGuess = 2;
String result = dot.checkYourself(userGuess);
String testResult = "failed";
if (result.equals("hit")) {
testResult = "passed";
}
System.out.println(testResult);
}
}

Q.In the next couple of pages we implement the SimpleStartup class,
and then later we return to the test class. Looking at our test code
above, what else should be added? What are we not testing in this
code that we should be testing for? Write your ideas (or lines of
code) below:

=> Check for multiple guesses.
=> Check for repeated guess made by the user.
=> Check for edge cases where the user made invalid input.
